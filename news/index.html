    <i>Nature Genetics </i>published "Reference genome assemblies reveal the origin and evolution of allohexaploid ".
     This study releases a reference-quality genome assembly of the hexaploid oat variety "Sanfensan" and genome assemblies of its diploid and tetraploid <i>Avena</i> ancestors, 
    also provides insights into the evolutionary history of allohexaploid oats. 
    Lipeng Kang was involved in the data analysis, good job!
